The help command can be used to access the mud's help files. Type
"help" followed by the name of the subject on which you would like
help. If the mud has a help file on that subject, you'll see it. If
you type "help" by itself, you'll see an introduction to the mud.

Currently, there is help on the following subjects:

introduction	commands	help

Wizards should also consult the documentation in /doc for help.
