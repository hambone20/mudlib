Welcome to Myan

A mud, or Multi User Dungeon, is a place where computer users can
connect and interact with one another. Originally, most muds were
games (hence the word dungeon) where players adventured together,
but recently they have been used for holding classes, for designing
programs, and for many other applications where people in different
parts of the world want to get together on a mud and work with each
other on some kind of task.

What you can do on a mud depends on what commands are available to
you. On this mud, you can learn what commands are available to you
by typing "help commands". You can learn more about using the help
system by typing "help help".
