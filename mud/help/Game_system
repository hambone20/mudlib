Game system treament - Hymael

The defined body and corresponding percentage of total:

- Head 		( 5%)
- Torso 	(45%)
- Left arm	(10%) NOTE: primary arm may be selected at creation 
- Right arm	(10%)
- Left leg	(15%)
- Right leg	(15%)

This is important because, for the most part, each attack will fall
into a foci on one of these areas, or in the case of splash damage,
one or more.  To an extent, a player will be able to direct attacks
toward a specific body unit, but that requires skill.  Focus of this
kind will largely be taken care of with an implementation of fighting
styles.  An example would be the combat style of modern day kickboxing
where opponents strike at one another's legs in the attempts to temporarily
cripple them.  

Armor will, of course, shield each centralized area.  An unprotected area
soon becomes fodder to opposing fighters.  Strategy will ensue in finding
the weakness of a given mob or player and focusing attacks designed to
reap the rewards of this foresight.  

A shield and some forms of fighting styles that use a parrying technique
with their weapons allows for heightened protection, before the fact.  A
shield, with it's ability to intercept an attack, can avoid damage altogether.
Shields will have a relatively low ac for this fact.  An intercepting shield
or weapon will give a message such as:

Jethro's shield intercepts your dirk.

The relative "points" divvied to each body part is a function of several things:

- Player's constitution (applying in amounts equal to the percentage)
- Player's race (i.e. dwarves are inherently more robust)
- Player's level
- Nagging injuries (more on injuries later)
- And many miscellaneous things will come into play

The healthiness of a given body part will be abstract to the player.
Superb condition will not be noted, but an ailing condition will:

- Superb condition
- Light wound
- Moderate wound
- Severe wound
- Critical wound

This gruesome combat system will neccessitate a very active cleric class.
Fighter's will be able, to an extent, deliver first aid in abating blood
loss and the like.

*Injuries*

Permanent and gruesome injuries will be implemented.  On everything moderate 
and up, there is a chance of something critical to happen.  There will be a 
table made that scales to gradually more hindersome injury traits.  Weapons
will deal damage according to type (i.e. blunt weapons will crush bones).

Examples:

Arm:
- (moderate) -> Weapon is dropped
- (moderate) -> Stunned for 2 rounds
- (moderate) -> Lose use of arm, until healed
- (severe)   -> Stunned for 4 rounds
- (severe)   -> Stunned for 6 rounds
- (severe)   -> Hand lost
- (critical) -> Arm lost, death imminent
- (critical) -> Arm lost, system shock death

Leg:
- (moderate) -> Stunned for 1 round
- (moderate) -> Effective dexterity lowered
- (moderate) -> Fall to ground
- (severe)   -> Stunned for 3 rounds
- (severe)   -> Movement hampered
- (severe)   -> Foot disabled
- (critical) -> Foot lost
- (critical) -> Leg lost, death imminent

Torso:
- (moderate) -> Stunned for 1 round
- (moderate) -> Armor class lowered
- (moderate) -> Stunned for 3 rounds
- (severe)   -> Bleeding wound
- (severe)   -> Organ damage
- (severe)   -> Stunned for 8 rounds
- (critical) -> Disemboweled
- (critical) -> Heart pierced, death

Head:
- (moderate) -> Dazed for 1 round
- (moderate) -> Effective intelligence lowered
- (moderate) -> Stunned for 2 rounds
- (severe)   -> Sight impaired
- (severe)   -> Loss of equilibrium, stunned for 10 rounds
- (severe)   -> Unconscious
- (critical) -> Unconscious, permanent intelligence loss
- (critical) -> Death

These are just some rough ideas of what could populate these tables.  That
being much of the paint, it will take some time to flush out and balance.

*Combat*

To up the stakes even further, combat will have a defined "lock" state.

Example:

- Our hero, Jethro, enters a room and finds it inhabited by an ogre
- Jethro, sporting a longbow, begins to lace the ogre's hide with arrows
- The ogre, with no missile weapon, charges Jethro
- Charging takes time, meanwhile Jethro pumps more arrows into the ogre
- Now, the charging time has passed, and the ogre "locks" with Jethro
- Jethro, having not readied his sword, is in bad shape, losing rounds
  while he readies his sword

Several things need to be defined beforehand, namely encounter distances.
Each room will thusly inherit a value for this, as it will differ from
room to room.  And weapons will be labeled melee or missile, or both.
A melee weapon will only be effective if "locked" with an opponent and
missile weapons will only be effective when "unlocked".

There will be numerous ways in which to engage an opponent.  Namely the
"melee" command.  Other will have differing attributes.  A possible one
being "charge".  This will reduce the encounter distance to "lock" and
will heighten the charging person's attack rating while lowering their
defense.  Another possible "lock" skill could be "sneak", in which the
perpetrator attempts to disguise their approach.  Yet another possibility
is "approach", in which a person cautiously approaches an attacker with
heightened defense but which takes longer to engage.

Some weapons, such as polearms, fall under a category of "reach".  With
these weapons, the wielder evades a "locked" state while attacking an
opponent at range.  If the opponent manages to evade the polearm and
enter a locked state, these types of weapons become largely ineffective
and will reflect such.

The ability to stay "unlocked" and to thus disengage if "locked" is a
valued skill.  This will largely be a function of dexterity and prowess
at combat.  A "locked" person can, at the expense of several undefensed
attacks, "flee".  This means there is a zero-barrier to fleeing.  There
will also be a "withdrawal" in which one fights their way out of combat
over a period of time.  The person committing to a withdrawal will have
heightened defense and little to no offense.

With all these states of combat, there is required a command to change an
individual's tactics.  This will be done by fighter types through the
command, "assume".  "Assume" tells the player's character to assume a
given fighting style. Some examples of such follow.

Fighting Styles:

- (Berserker)   -> Player fights with crazed abandon, little or no tactics
		   with heightened attack and lowered defense.  Stuns have
		   little effect.  Player cannot withdraw or flee.

- (Swashbuckler)-> Player fights with poise, using terrain to their advantage.
		   Requires suitable weaponry.  Attacks have a heightened
		   chance of criticals.
		
- (Swordmaster) -> Style requires much player skill.  Targets vital areas
		   on their opponent with heightened damage and criticals.
		   Must be fighting with a weapon in which they're proficient.
		   
- (Mounted)     -> Requires mount of course.  This may be a pass type combat
		   where the mounted combatant locks briefly then disengages
		   and makes another pass.
		  
- (Grappler)    ->

- (Dirty)       ->

- (Sharpshooter)->

*The Combat Round*

What follows is a sample of combat flow:

- Jethro enters a room, inhabited by Thol, the fierce orcish warrior
- Thol, being aggressive toward Jethro's race and having readied a
  sling, begins chucking stones at Jethro
- Jethro, issues the command to "cover" which heightens his armor class
  versus missile weapons and, after 2 rounds, he is virtually immune
- Thol, running short on stones and bloodthirsty, drops his sling and,
  readying his rusty mace, charges Jethro
- Jethro, noting Thol's aggressive charge, issues a "set for charge" which
  further heightens his ability to attack versus a charge Jethro also
  issues an "assume sword and shield", to adopt his trained fighting
  style
- The room, having been given an encounter range of 6 and Thol wasn't
  set for "ambush", sees Thol approach Jethro, Jethro sees:
  
  Thol bears down on you in a charge!
  Thol bears down on you in a charge!
  
  You receive an attack of oppurtunity for having set.(this is at heightened
  						       attack)
  Thol engages you in melee!
  (Thol's charge effectively wears off)
  (Jethro has wielded a sword and shield)
  (Thol wields the rusty mace)
  Thol swipes at you with his rusty mace but misses.
  
  You strike Thol in the abdomen with your fine sword, scoring a light wound.
  (Jethro issues a "look thol")
  Thol, the fierce orcish warrior
  
  Thol bleeds from a light wound on his torso.
  (description)
  
  Your shield intercepts Thol's rusty mace with a clang!
  (Thol sees, Jethro's shield intercepts your mace with a clang!)
  
  You attack Thol with your fine sword but miss.
  
  Thol pounds you in the leg with his rusty mace, opening a moderate wound.
  (critical damage code)
  You fall to the ground!(Jethro enters prone state, in which his ac is lowered,
                          to stand next round)
  Thol hammers you in the head with his rusty mace, delivering a severe blow.
  (critical damage code)
  You lose your equilibrium!
  ...
  
Of course, the actual critical events won't happen near as often as this, unless
skills are very divergent.


*Flight*

Flight will be possible, as will many varying types of mounts.  A character
under the influence of a flight spell, or atop a flying mount, will be able
to go "aloft".  When aloft, the player will be on a virtual grid server that
mirrors the rooms below.  Each room must thusly be labeled indoor or outdoor,
defaulting to outdoor.  They will see something such as:

The Sky over (room's name)

  The wind whips you about as you soar atop your (mount's name).
  (list members of this sky room)
  Below you sprawls the countryside, you can make out...

(room description of the room below)
  (occupants)
  
There will be an optional feature that allows the flying player to observe
an adjacent room, via "look direction".

Combat will be handled in short swoops, with quick locking and unlocking phases.

*Character Creation*

Character creation will largely be dealt with in an evolving fashion.  At the very
beginning, the player will be given a choice.

Doctrines:

- Craftsman
- Noble
- Street Urchin
- Spiritual
- Wilder (need a better name for one disposed to the wilderness)
- Scholar

*Craftsman*

Craftspersons will play a vital role in the scheme of things, and indeed they'll
be the recommended starting character.  Weapons and armor, and most equipment, will
suffer wear and eventually need repair.  That's where the craftsmen come in.  Depending
on the craft chosen, attributes may become better accordingly.  Say one chooses to
smith armors as an occupation, their strength would gradually become great from the
strain.  And if one were to take up sewing, their dexterity would increase.  

The inherent goal of this doctrine is to become skilled in their practice and make
money hand and fist.  Also, highly skilled craftsmen will be highly sought in
Coteries (to be expounded on later).

*Noble*

Nobles were born with a silver spoon and are more disposed to political intrigue than
fighting or crafting.  Their role is often one of leading.  They benefit in that they
have reputation and often much pull in political branches.

*Street Urchin*

The street urchin is a hardly soul that has grown up in the streets, fighting for scraps
and often stealing.  They are easily disposed to dirty tactics and theft.  From their
humble stature, they often grow into powerful underworld influences, if they can avoid
imprisonment or having their throats slit.

*Spiritual*

This doctrine is most suitable to the clerical arts.  They are often the only ones that
can can cure some of the more gruesome wounds.  They play a very powerful role in day
to day activities.

*Wilder*

This is a person disposed to the wilderness.  They are often quite skilled with a bow
and fit the role of a ranger.  Some also learn the ways in which to befriend the wild
elements and exercise the way of the druids.

*Scholar*

This is the only doctrine that specifically pursues the magicial arts, a very tedious
task to be sure.  Often they are forced into days of perusing old tomes in their
pursuit for spells and magical means.  They may also take up in a noble court and offer
their ensights.

*Coteries*

As I mentioned Coteries in passing above, I'll explain them further.  A Coterie is
a collective group of persons that get together and pledge their loyalty to a common
goal.  They then recruit craftsmen to build their stronghold.  This stronghold then
becomes their center of operations.  Most people will find their niche in a given
Coterie, others will avoid them entirely.  Coteries often fall into battle with other
Coteries, when a perceived wrong was done or due to conflicting beliefs.  In the case
of a full on Coterie battle, strongholds will be under siege by the aggressor.

*Death*

The all important state of death.  Upon the issuance of a death knell, the dying person
will be exiled to the Labyrinth.  This is a harsh testing ground where the person must
earn their way back into society.  One is confronted with trials depending on their
doctrine.  A scholar might face several tests of the mind, whereas a hardy fighter-type
may face the scorn of many abominable beasts.  Many things can be learned from one's time
in the Labyrinth.  Indeed, one's character goes through many changes here.

The Labyrinth's difficulty is based on the experiences of the character.  The more
a character has progressed, the more difficult the Labyrinth will become to escape.
Upon escape of the Labyrinth, a person must try to assume their status again.

*Notes on Monster Spawns*

Monster spawning will be dealt with in a very different manor.  There will be very few
static spawns.  Many monsters will have a large stronghold of their specific race, one
so large that it would take a great force of players to assault it.  Insomuch as this
stronghold is unlikely to be challenged often, it is free to breed its beasts.  Often,
the stronghold will only be dealt with abstractly, with a tally of beasts within, and
remain unloaded.  But, randomly beasts will be dispersed from within, to roam to set areas
and await battle with players.  

Of course, there will be many different varieties of the spawn.  When players do manage to
gang together and take on the stronghold, they will reap many benefits.  If the players do
destroy the populace, that particular race will dwindle, to recover over time.

*Adventurers*

Inevitably, some persons will want to forsake their present doctrine to become an
adventurer.  This is done by simply doing.  One retains their previous skills but they do
slowly deteriorate without use.  The player is free to do what they want, but their
previous pasttime will influence how effective they are at a given task.

Example:

- Bob has been a craftsman since creation, and has done mostly sewing
- But Bob longs for the life of an adventurer
- Bob finds himself a sword and wanders out into the countryside, seeking
  adventure
- He finds that his dexterity gained from those long hours of sewing
  benefit him in a quick, agile fighting style
- And so, Bob becomes a quite skilled fighter from his humble beginnings

*Possible Crafts*

This will be an area possible for much expansion, a list of possible crafts
follow.

Crafts:

- Weaponsmithing (fabrication and repair of weaponry)
- Armorer        (fabrication and repair of armor)
- Sewing         (fabrication and repair of clothes)
- Cooking        (fabrication of food)
- Brewing        (fabrication of alcohol)
- Mining         (collection of ores)
- Bowyer         (fabrication and repair of bows/arrows)
- Builder        (skilled in building domiciles, sought by Coteries)
- Alchemist      (fabrication of potions and elixirs)
