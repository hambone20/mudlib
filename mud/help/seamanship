Ship to Ship Ventures

To open up an avenue of wanderlust and exploration, with group
implications.  

-First we start off by defining a grid that will represent our
 ocean.  Each coordinate pair will represent a room of sorts.

-Filling each of these "rooms" will be a function that executes
 any time a ship enters it, or a nil value representing nothing.

-If at any time two ships occupy the same space, they are assumed
 to be boarding each other, and a passageway will develop between
 the two.
 
-The functions held in the "rooms" will be called at entrance, so
 they can handle an event as they see fit, be it a discovery of
 land or a new turbulance to the ocean.
 
-The ships themselves will be an object containing several rooms.

-Among these defined rooms aboard the ship, will be the helm,
 poop deck, forecastle deck, quarter deck, crow's nest and other
 appropriate territories.
 
-Piloting the vessel will consist of a required amount of seamen
 in the places to man sails, and a driver at the helm, steering
 the vessel.
 
-Each vessel will have a rating on how well they utilize wind, a
 function of the current winds, the quality of the vessel and
 the talent of its crew.  This determines how long it takes to
 traverse an ocean room.
 
-Seamanship will be required to determine where one is on the wide
 ocean.  This mainly demonstrates a latitude and current direction.
 
-Steering will turn the direction one increment either right or left
 in the typical cardinal directions.
 
-The crow's nest has a peculiar feature in that they can foresee what
 is several ocean "rooms" ahead.  
 
-Communication aboard will be dealt with in a localized channel for
 the entire boat.

-Seamen are required to be very agile, so a sailor with full plate on
 doesn't count as a sailor.
 
-A ships heading is stored as a coordinate pair, i.e. (-1, 1) which
 would denote a heading of northwest, basically the first number
 denotes whether it is west or east and the second north or south.
 
-This system may be extended with the use of a ship to ship combat
 via ranged weapons.
 
-All ships must have a unique name to better handle portage.
